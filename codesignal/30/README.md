## Task description
You are given two exceedingly large positive decimal numbers, num1 and num2, both represented as strings. The length of these strings can range anywhere from 1 to 500 characters. The challenge here is to subtract num2 from num1 without directly converting the strings into integers.

Create a Python function that performs this operation and returns the resultant string, referred to as num3.

Please note that the subtraction will not result in a negative number, as num1 will always be greater than or equal to num2.
